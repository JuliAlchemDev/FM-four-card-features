## My process
- I initialized a new repository and submitted the project.
- I cleaned up the README file and removed source files that I wouldn’t use.
- I studied the design system in Figma and prepared custom CSS properties, carefully choosing reusable and consistent naming conventions.
- Linked styles to the HTML and downloaded the project fonts.  
  I also added **preload** for performance, but the browser shows a warning:  
  *“The resource was preloaded but not used…”* — I’ll revisit and fix that later.  

- Exported image assets from Figma.  
  After checking the design, I noticed all screen sizes use the same image dimensions,  
  so for better organization, I placed all images inside the **assets** folder.  

- Analyzed the design layout and started building the structure with **semantic HTML** and **BEM naming**.  

- Added some **accessibility features**, such as `aria-labelledby` for sections.  
  **Note:** Use `aria-labelledby` when there’s visible text (like a heading, caption, or label) that already describes the element.

- Prepared **media queries** for the next design phase.  

- Used `::before` pseudo-element and `overflow` to style the cards.  
  Had some challenges recreating the exact **shadow styles** from Figma,  
  so I decided to adjust them on my own for a balanced visual result.
