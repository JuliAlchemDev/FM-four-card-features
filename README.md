## My process
- I initialized a new repository and submitted the project.
- I cleaned up the README file and removed source files that I wouldn’t use.
- I studied the design system in Figma and prepared custom CSS properties, carefully choosing reusable and consistent naming conventions.

-link styles to html, download and preload fonts(have and warning in the browser, it says: link preload but not used... i'll face it next ).
- next step export images sizes from figma for different screens. So i checked all images sizes in a design and it use the same on over all sreens. So for better organization i put muy ingages in asssets folder. Now i can go to anilize design layout and start with semantic html and bem naming. Add some accessibilyti features like  aria-labelledby for secions. Note: Use aria-labelledby when:
There’s visible text (like a heading, caption, or label) that already describes the element.
